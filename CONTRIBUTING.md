# Contributing to Space Weather Project

## Project Objectives
This project aims to develop a comprehensive web application for monitoring various space weather indices and phenomena. It integrates backend Python scripts for data retrieval and processing with a frontend interface for visualization and user interaction.

## Task List
1. Wrap Data Fetching Scripts: Convert existing Python scripts for data fetching into callable functions.
2. API Endpoint Processing: Write Python functions to process and interpret data for each API endpoint.
3. Flask Backend Setup: Establish a Flask server and define the necessary routes for API data handling.
4. Frontend Redesign: Evaluate the possibility of adopting a frontend framework like React.
5. Frontend-Backend Integration: Implement the API calls between the frontend and backend.
6. Search and Filters: Implement frontend features for data searching and filtering.
7. Interactive Visualizations: Add interactive data visualizations on the frontend.
8. Documentation Expansion: Add to the existing API usage guide and codebase documentation.
9. Testing Strategy: Develop unit tests, integration tests, and outline user testing methods.
10. Deployment Preparation: Prepare the codebase for eventual deployment, following best practices.

## Iteration 3 Update
- Exploration of Python scripts related to data fetching and processing to identify areas requiring additional features or completion.

## Iteration 3 Update
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md to guide potential contributors on the project objectives and task list.

## Iteration 3 - Manual Code Inspection Update
- Conducted a thorough manual inspection of backend Python files.
- Added inline TODO comments to identify areas requiring attention or further development.

## Iteration 4 Preparations
- Added a `requirements.txt` in the backend directory for managing Python package dependencies.
