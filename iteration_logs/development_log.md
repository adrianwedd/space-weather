# Development Log for Space Weather Project


## Iteration 1: Initial Code Exploration (Backend)

### Observations
- No existing inline TODOs, FIXMEs, or PLACEHOLDER comments were found in the backend Python files.

### Insights
- The absence of such markers suggests that either the code is complete in its existing form or areas requiring attention have not been explicitly marked.

### Reflections
- The task of identifying areas requiring attention becomes crucial for further development.


## Iteration 2: README Initialization

### Observations
- Enhanced the README.md with a more detailed project overview and setup guidelines.

### Insights
- Providing setup guidelines in the README aids in onboarding new developers or users, facilitating a smoother interaction with the project.

### Reflections
- The README serves as the front door of the project, making it essential to keep it informative and up-to-date.


## Iteration 3: Data Fetching Scripts and CONTRIBUTING.md Initialization

### Observations
- Created a CONTRIBUTING.md file detailing the project objectives and task list.

### Insights
- A well-documented contributing guide helps in setting expectations and clarifying the roadmap for potential contributors.

### Reflections
- The initialization of CONTRIBUTING.md aligns with best practices in open-source development, providing a detailed guide for contributions.


## Iteration 3: Manual Code Inspection (Backend)

### Observations
- Added inline TODO comments in Python files to mark areas needing attention.
- Key findings include the presence of import statements, multiple function definitions, and main execution blocks.

### Insights
- Manual inspection offers a comprehensive understanding of the codebase, identifying areas that require further development or review.

### Reflections
- The inline TODO comments will serve as guiding markers for subsequent development steps, ensuring that no crucial area is overlooked.


## Iteration 4 Preparations
- Added a `requirements.txt` in the backend directory for managing Python package dependencies.
