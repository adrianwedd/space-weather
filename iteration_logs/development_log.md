# Development Log for Space Weather Project


## Iteration 1: Initial Code Exploration (Backend)

### Observations
- No existing inline TODOs, FIXMEs, or PLACEHOLDER comments were found in the backend Python files.

### Insights
- The absence of such markers suggests that either the code is complete in its existing form or areas requiring attention have not been explicitly marked.

### Reflections
- The task of identifying areas requiring attention becomes crucial for further development.


## Iteration 2: README Initialization

### Observations
- Enhanced the README.md with a more detailed project overview and setup guidelines.

### Insights
- Providing setup guidelines in the README aids in onboarding new developers or users, facilitating a smoother interaction with the project.

### Reflections
- The README serves as the front door of the project, making it essential to keep it informative and up-to-date.


## Iteration 3: Data Fetching Scripts and CONTRIBUTING.md Initialization

### Observations
- Created a CONTRIBUTING.md file detailing the project objectives and task list.

### Insights
- A well-documented contributing guide helps in setting expectations and clarifying the roadmap for potential contributors.

### Reflections
- The initialization of CONTRIBUTING.md aligns with best practices in open-source development, providing a detailed guide for contributions.


## Iteration 3: Manual Code Inspection (Backend)

### Observations
- Added inline TODO comments in Python files to mark areas needing attention.
- Key findings include the presence of import statements, multiple function definitions, and main execution blocks.

### Insights
- Manual inspection offers a comprehensive understanding of the codebase, identifying areas that require further development or review.

### Reflections
- The inline TODO comments will serve as guiding markers for subsequent development steps, ensuring that no crucial area is overlooked.


## Iteration 4 Preparations
- Added a `requirements.txt` in the backend directory for managing Python package dependencies.

## Task List Revision

### Observations
- Revised the existing task list to better align with the current state and future direction of the project.

### Insights
- A well-structured task list serves as a roadmap, guiding the development efforts in a focused manner.

### Reflections
- Periodic revisions of the task list are essential to adapt to new insights and requirements.


## Iteration 4: Manual Code Inspection (Frontend)

### Observations
- Added inline TODO comments in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to highlight areas needing attention.
- Key findings include the presence of HTML elements requiring semantic and accessibility review, as well as CSS rules that may need optimization.

### Insights
- Manual inspection serves as a proactive measure to identify areas in the frontend code that require optimization, feature addition, or completion.

### Reflections
- The inline TODO comments will act as signposts, steering the development towards improving user experience and code quality.


## Iteration 5: Backend Data Wrapping

### Observations
- The backend Python script `data_retrieval.py` was identified as the primary source for data fetching.
- The file currently has API-related configurations and import statements.

### Insights
- The existing code needs to be converted into callable functions and organized into appropriate modules.
- Handling API keys securely and implementing error-handling mechanisms are crucial.

### Subtasks
1. Function Wrapping: Convert existing code for data retrieval into callable Python functions.
2. Modularization: Organize the functions into appropriate Python modules.
3. API Key Management: Implement a secure way to handle API keys.
4. Error Handling: Incorporate error-handling and logging mechanisms.


## Iteration 6: Function Wrapping

### Observations
- Created a new Python file `modularized_data_retrieval.py` to house modular functions for data retrieval.
- Introduced a skeleton function `fetch_data_from_api` that encapsulates the logic for API data fetching.

### Insights
- Function wrapping enhances code maintainability and sets the stage for easier debugging and future improvements.


## Iteration 7: Backend Modularization

### Observations
- Created three new Python modules in the backend directory:
  1. `data_retrieval_module.py`: For data retrieval functions.
  2. `data_manipulation_module.py`: For data manipulation and transformation functions.
  3. `data_storage_module.py`: For data storage and database interaction functions.

### Insights
- Modularization enhances code organization, making it more scalable and maintainable.


## Iteration 8: Secure API Key Management

### Observations
- Updated `modularized_data_retrieval.py` to securely fetch the API key from an environment variable.

### Insights
- Utilizing environment variables for sensitive credentials enhances the security of the application.


## Iteration 9: Error Handling and Logging

### Observations
- Added basic error handling and logging mechanisms in `modularized_data_retrieval.py`.

### Insights
- Error handling and logging are essential for robust applications, aiding in debugging and monitoring.


## Iteration 10: Frontend Refinement

### Observations
- Identified inline TODO comments in `index.html` and `base.html` outlining required refinements.
- Implemented semantic and accessibility improvements in the HTML elements.

### Insights
- Semantic and accessibility refinements are essential for creating a more inclusive and user-friendly application.


## Iteration 11: Backend Placeholder Implementations

### Observations
- Identified placeholder implementations and TODO comments in backend Python files.
- Started the implementation process by refining the `get_a_index` function in `data_retrieval.py`.

### Insights
- Placeholder implementations serve as markers that guide future development. Detailed inline comments provide a roadmap for completing these implementations.


## Iteration 12: Writing Unit Tests

### Observations
- Initiated the process of writing unit tests for backend functions.
- Created a sample unit test for the `get_a_index` function in `data_retrieval.py`.

### Insights
- Unit tests are crucial for validating the functionality and robustness of backend functions.
