# Iteration Log for Version 0.0.54

## Developments

- Conducted a scan of the entire codebase to pinpoint areas that either lack or require enriched TODOs and documentation.
- Updated TODOs for more clarity and added inline documentation opportunities.

## Challenges

- Ensuring the consistency of documentation across different parts of the project.
- Balancing the level of detail in TODOs and documentation.

## Resolutions

- Adopted a uniform template for TODOs and inline documentation to maintain consistency.
- Included comments asking for more details in both TODOs and potential documentation lines to ensure adequate context is provided in future updates.
