# API to Fetch Real-Time Space Weather Data

# Sample code for API to fetch real-time space weather data
import requests  # Documentation: Please describe the functionality in detail.

# TODO: In this section, you need to securely manage the API key. Avoid hardcoding the API key directly into the code. Use Python's `os` library to read the key from environment variables. You can set the environment variable using `export API_KEY=your_actual_key` in a UNIX-like shell, or use similar methods for other operating systems.  # Updated TODO: Please elaborate on the implementation details.

    # Implementation to handle the API response and extract real-time data will be added here
# TODO: Here, you should implement the logic to make a GET request to a specific API endpoint. Use the `requests` library to make the HTTP request. Include error-handling mechanisms to retry the request in case of temporary failures.  # Updated TODO: Please elaborate on the implementation details.
