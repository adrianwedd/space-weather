    TODO: Create essential visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
    
    1. Histograms: Create histograms for each variable to understand its distribution.
       - Use matplotlib or seaborn to generate histograms.
       - Save the plots as image files for further analysis or display.
    
    2. Scatter Plots: Generate scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
       - Identify key variables that are likely to have relationships.
       - Use color coding to add another dimension to the visualization.
    
    3. Heatmaps: Create heatmaps to visualize correlation matrices.
       - Use seaborn's heatmap function to generate a heatmap of the correlation matrix.
       - Annotate the heatmap with correlation values for clarity.
